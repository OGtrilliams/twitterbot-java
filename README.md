# Twitter Bot - Java

I built this twitter bot to automate few tasks on twitter with respect to GDG New Delhi.

###Steps
1. Create a file named `twitter4j.properties` and update it with credentials from your twitter dashboard

    ```
   oauth.consumerKey=Your_Consumer_Key
    oauth.consumerSecret=Your_Consumer_Secret
    oauth.accessToken=Your_Access_Token
    oauth.accessTokenSecret=Your_Access_Token_Secret
    ``` 
1. Configure and code your twitter bot under the `TwitterBot.java` file.
